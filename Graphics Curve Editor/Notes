Note: I held off submitting in case I had time to finish Bezier Counter over the past week but I did not have any time so this is essentially the version as it existed on Thursday 10/30.

Implemented Items:
    Curves:
        - P Polyline
        - B Bezier
        - L Lagrange
        - C Catmull-Clark Subdivision (default set to 3 subdivisions) (20)

    Functional Keys:
        - SPACE selects the next curve (5)
        - F fills in (convex) curves (5)
        - D deletes control points (10)
        - A adds control points (5)
        - Z clears all the curves on the screen (0)

    Other Functionalities:
        - Curve selection (15)
            (doesn't work amazingly well for Polyline and Subdivision)
        - Control point dragging (10)
        - Curve dragging (15)

    Total: 85/85 Points

Thank you again for the extra time.
